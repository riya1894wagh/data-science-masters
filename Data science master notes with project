The focus of Python 3 development was to clean up the codebase and remove redundancy, making it clear that there was only one way to perform a given task.\n",
    "* Major modifications to Python 3.0 included changing the print statement into a built-in function, improve the way integers are divided, and providing more Unicode support.\n",
    "* At first, Python 3 was slowly adopted due to the language not being backwards compatible with Python 2, requiring people to make a decision as to which version of the language to use. Additionally, many package libraries were only available for Python 2, but as the development team behind Python 3 has reiterated that there is an end of life for Python 2 support, more libraries have been ported to Python 3. The increased adoption of Python 3 can be shown by the number of Python packages that now provide Python 3 support, which at the time of writing includes 339 of the 360 most popular Python packages.\n",

The intention behind Python 2.7 was to make it easier for Python 2.x users to port features over to Python 3 by providing some measure of compatibility between the two. This compatibility support included enhanced modules for version 2.7 like unittest to support test automation, argparse for parsing command-line options, and more convenient classes in collections.\n",

When we talk about Python 2 today, we are typically referring to the Python 2.7 release as that is the most frequently used version.\n",

    "Among numerous languages available in the market why should you choose python? This is the first question that arises in the mind of new users. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following are the som of the reasons why people select python-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Quality of software**:\n",
    "Python was meant for readability. Its reusable and maintainable as compared to other languages. Its easier to understand. It supports all the modern features like OOPs and functional programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Productivity of Developers**:\n",
    "The same program which is written in other high-level languages like c++ or java can be written in one-third or one-fifth line of codes. That means debugging can be easy and it will be less prone to error which in turn increases the productivity of the developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Portability**:\n",
    "Mostly it’s platform-independent. It can run on any platform or OS with minor or no change at all which makes it a highly portable language. Now you can use MircoPython to interact with hardware as well. It can be used on most of the edge devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Supporting Libraries**:\n",
    "Python already has a lot of inbuilt libraries that come with the standard python package which you download from its <a href=\"https://www.python.org/\"  target=\"_blank\">official site</a>. With these libraries, you can build lots of basic applications or day to day automation tasks like copying data in bulk from one place to another. Apart from this, there’s a huge list of third-party libraries like Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit Learn, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fun to use**:\n",
    "Its simplicity and availability of lots of supporting libraries plus huge open source community support make development in python a breeze. That’s why its widely preferred by hobbyists as well.\n",
