    "* Both Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are techniques for converting categorical variables into numerical representations for machine learning algorithms. However, they differ in how they treat the order of the categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding: Preserves the order of the categories by assigning sequential integer values.expand_more For example, a category with \"Low\", \"Medium\", and \"High\" could be encoded as 1, 2, and 3 respectively. This is useful when the order of the categories has meaning, like customer satisfaction levels or shirt sizes.expand_more\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding: Simply assigns a unique integer to each category without considering any order.expand_more So \"Low\", \"Medium\", and \"High\" could be encoded as 1, 0, and 2 (or any other unique assignment). This is suitable for nominal data where the order doesn't matter, like colors (red, blue, green) or weekdays (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday).expand_more\n",
    "\n",
    "* Choosing the Right Technique:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Ordinal Encoding when the order of the categories is important for your analysis. For instance, if you're looking at customer satisfaction (Very Dissatisfied, Dissatisfied, Neutral, Satisfied, Very Satisfied), ordinal encoding would be appropriate because higher numbers indicate greater satisfaction.\n",

    "Target-guided ordinal encoding is a technique that leverages the relationship between a categorical feature and the target variable to assign numerical values. It assumes a natural order exists within the categories and that this order influences the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate Target Statistics: For each category in the categorical feature, calculate a statistic that reflects its relationship with the target variable. This statistic could be the mean, median, or another appropriate measure depending on the target variable's type (continuous or categorical).\n",
    "2. Sort Categories: Sort the categories based on the calculated statistics in descending (or ascending) order depending on whether higher values in the target variable are favorable.\n",
    "3. Assign Encodings: Assign numerical values to the categories based on their sorted order. The first category (with the highest or lowest target variable statistic) gets the value 1, the second gets 2, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a dataset on customer satisfaction with a categorical feature \"Product Tier\" (Basic, Standard, Premium) and a target variable \"Satisfaction Score\" (1-5 scale). You might use target-guided ordinal encoding if there's an expected positive correlation between tier and satisfaction score.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Use:\n",
    "\n",
    "* This approach is beneficial when:\n",
    "    * The categorical feature has a natural order.\n",
    "    * The target variable is continuous (like the satisfaction score) or ordinal (like customer ratings).\n",
